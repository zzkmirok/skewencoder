## Installation
### Installation requirements
1. Plumed version >= 2.9.0 and pytorch module linked with libtorch.lib is required.
2. CP2K installation is also required and should be linked to plumed.
3. For a better implementation create a separate python virtual env and install the autoencoder.
### How to install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zzkmirok/skewencoder.git
cd skewencoder
pip install [-e] .
```
